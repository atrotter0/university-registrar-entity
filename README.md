## Description

A .NET web app that allows a user to add and delete students, add classes, and register students for new classes.

## User Stories

* As a registrar, I want to enter a student, so I can keep track of all students enrolled at this University. I should be able to provide a name and date of enrollment.
* As a registrar, I want to enter a course, so I can keep track of all of the courses the University offers. I should be able to provide a course name and a course number (ex. HIST100).
